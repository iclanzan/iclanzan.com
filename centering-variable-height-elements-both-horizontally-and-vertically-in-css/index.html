I have been wanting to write about this for quite a while now, but this seems like a very opportune moment to do so.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: I am not the originator of this method. I have read about it years ago on a couple of websites I don’t recall.</em></p><p>For those of you who are only interested in seeing some code in action check out <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/iclanzan/sDW63/>this fiddle</a>.</p><p>The problem with the method presented in the aforementioned article is that it requires the height of the element to be declared. This can be avoided by adding <code>display: table</code> to the rule but this only works in some browsers.</p><p>Beginners in the arts of Cascading Style Sheets expect the <code>vertical-align</code> property to achieve the desired result and believe it or not this same property is at the heart of the method I am presenting. Aside from table-cell elements, the property also applies to inline-level elements. That means elements that are either <code>inline</code> or <code>inline-block</code>.</p><p>Now consider a container with two child elements with <code>display: inline-block</code> and <code>vertical-align: center</code>. If one of them is the same height as the container, the other one will end up vertically centered. Add <code>text-align: center</code> to the container and, assuming that the full-height element is empty, you now have an element that is centered both vertically and horizontally. Even better, as can be seen from the example fiddle, a pseudo-element can be used instead of the unneeded element.</p><p>Is this amazing or what?</p></section><footer><section><p class=center><a class=section title="Built with Section" href=http://section.iclanzan.com><span></span><strong>Section</strong></a></p></section></footer></main><script>/(iPad|iPhone|iPod)/g.test(navigator.userAgent)&&document.documentElement.classList.add('ios');</script>
