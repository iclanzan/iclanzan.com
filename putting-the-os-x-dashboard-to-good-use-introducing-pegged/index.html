But gathering all that data doesn’t help much if you have no way of visualizing and monitoring it for changes.</p><p>For this I’m using <a href=https://ducksboard.com/>Ducksboard</a>. It allows you to create dashboards where you can place beautiful stat widgets like counters and graphs. The main reason I went with Ducksboard is the gorgeous user interface. I could stare at those widgets for hours. In fact I used to have a browser tab width Ducksboard open at all times—until now that is.</p><h3 id=dashboard-web-clip-widgets>Dashboard “Web Clip” widgets</h3><p>In wanting to save that browser tab space while also maintaining easy access to stats I thought of using those Ducksboard widgets as OS X Dashboard widgets. The <em>Dashboard</em> has been available in Mac OS X since <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.4>Tiger</a> but isn’t widely used. There is even a built in widget called <em>Web Clip</em> that allows you to easily construct widgets by selecting portions of a website in Safari. This seemed like an easy solution for what I wanted to achieve.</p><p>But it wasn’t. I wanted to create widgets from the embed URLs provided by Ducksboard in order to avoid the overhead associated with loading the entire dashboard just to clip a widget. I encountered three major issues trying to go this route:</p><ul><li>The widget was taking up the entire browser window and Safari wasn’t letting me shrink the window to the required size for me to create the web clip.</li><li><em>Web Clip</em> widgets look horrible. The widget adds decorations and gloss on top and around the content.</li><li>You cannot interact with the website inside the widget.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately this meant that the <em>Web Clip</em> widget was not a good fit.</p><h3 id=rolling-my-own-solution>Rolling my own solution</h3><p>Dashboard widgets are built with HTML, CSS and of course JavaScript which made it very tempting for me to create my own—which I did. Now I won’t go into the technical aspect of creating the widget (I’ll keep that for another time) but I called it <strong>Pegged</strong> and you can check it out on <a href=https://github.com/iclanzan/pegged>GitHub</a>. This is how it looks like configured to display a Ducksboard widget:</p><iframe src=https://public.ducksboard.com/w/IO_lPQIYOOBKe4qOot77 width=300 height=146 style="border:0;box-shadow:0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.5);margin:1.5em auto;display:block"></iframe><p>In case you are wondering, this is a live widget displaying the daily unique visitor count for <a href=/>iclanzan.com</a>—sadly it is not real-time.</p><p>Installing and configuring Pegged requires very little effort. Just <a href=https://github.com/iclanzan/pegged/archive/master.zip>download</a> the archive from GitHub and unpack it then double click on <code>Pegged.wdgt</code> to install. You can then add it to the Dashboard as you would any other widget. It will ask you for a <em>URL</em> to load and you can also customize the <em>Width</em> and <em>Height</em> of the widget. The default size is perfect for a small Ducksboard widget like the one you see above.</p><p><em>I released Pegged on GitHub hoping that it might be useful to others as well. I would love it if you let me know how you use it!</em></p></section><footer><section><p class=center><a class=section title="Built with Section" href=http://section.iclanzan.com><span></span><strong>Section</strong></a></p></section></footer></main><script>/(iPad|iPhone|iPod)/g.test(navigator.userAgent)&&document.documentElement.classList.add('ios');</script>
